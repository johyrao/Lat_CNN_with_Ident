Lateralization CNN with ability to do disease identification

## Abstract
Convolutional neural networks have gained quick popularity in the last decade for image classification because they are uniquely well suited to parse out features and weight the values into a classification system. One domain that has seen particular benefit is the medical imaging community. Radiologists are hard to train, sometimes produce errors, and have a limited ability to detect subtle features of the image, as is to be expected from the limits of human physiology, so convolutional neural networks have proven a promising solution. I trained a convolutional neural network to differentiate between MRI images of right-side and left-side mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients as well as from a healthy control population and show the potential of applications of artificial intelligence in this field.
